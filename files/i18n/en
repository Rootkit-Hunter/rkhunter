#
# We start with the definitions of the message types and results. There
# are very few of these, so including these and all the parts of each
# message in one file makes sense and for easier translation.
#
# The message type MSG_TYPE_PLAIN is used for ordinary messages. It has
# no specific value, and is intercepted in the display function. It is
# included here for completeness. The index names of MSG_TYPE_ and
# MSG_RESULT_ are reserved - no messages can use this as part of its index.
#
MSG_TYPE_PLAIN:
MSG_TYPE_INFO:Info
MSG_TYPE_WARNING:Warning


#
# This is the list of message results.
#
MSG_RESULT_OK:OK
MSG_RESULT_BAD:BAD
MSG_RESULT_SKIPPED:Skipped
MSG_RESULT_FOUND:Found
MSG_RESULT_NOT_FOUND:Not Found

MSG_RESULT_UPD:Updated
MSG_RESULT_NO_UPD:No update
MSG_RESULT_UPD_FAILED:Update failed
MSG_RESULT_VCHK_FAILED:Version check failed
