THE ROOTKIT HUNTER PROJECT
==========================

Copyright (c) 2003-2006, Michael Boelen
See the LICENSE file for conditions of use and distribution.

It is recommended that all users of RootKit Hunter (RKH) join the
rkhunter-users mailing list. Subscribing to the list can be done via
the RKH website at http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net

Additionally there is a low-volume rkhunter-announce mailing list,
which will contain announcements of new versions of RKH. Details of
the list can be found at the RKH web site.

A copy of the RKH FAQ is also available from the web site.


ROOTKIT HUNTER INSTALLATION
===========================

Unpacking the tar file should produce a single directory call
'rkhunter'. Within this directory is the installation script called
'installer.sh'.

To install RKH simply unpack the tarball and run the installation
script:

    tar zxf rkhunter-<version>.tar.gz
    cd rkhunter
    ./installer.sh

The default installation process will install a configuration file,
called 'rkhunter.conf', into the '/usr/local/etc' directory. Please
edit the configuration file according to your own system
requirements.

The main RKH script will be installed into the '/usr/local/bin'
directory. Man pages will be installed into 'user/local/share/man',
and other documentation will be installed into the
'/usr/local/share/doc/rkhunter' directory. RKH data files, and a
directory for temporary files, will be installed into
'/var/lib/rkhunter'. All directories will be created where
necessary.

If it is wished to install RKH into a different directory, then
there are two options which can be used:

    --installdir <dir>     specifies the main installation directory
                           (default is '/usr/local')
    --dbdir <dir>          specifies the directory for data and
                           temporary files
                           (default is '/var/lib/rkhunter')

To run RKH simply, as root, enter the following command:

    rkhunter -c

By default, the log file '/var/log/rkhunter.log' will be created. It
will contain the results of the checks made by RKH.


STANDALONE INSTALLATION
=======================

It is possible to run RKH standalone, that is, without it being
installed.

To do this unpack RKH as described above, and then install it using
the following command:

    ./installer.sh --standalone

It is then necessary to change to the 'files' directory:

    cd files

Within here will be a copy of the 'rkhunter.conf' configuration
file. You can modify this file according to your requirements if you
wish.

To run RKH, enter the following command:

    ./rkhunter -c --configfile ./rkhunter.conf --dbdir . --tmpdir .

If you do not want a log file produced, then append the '--nolog'
option to the above command.


ROOTKIT HUNTER SUPPORT
======================

When a problem is found with RKH it is recommended that users
initially try and resolve the problem themselves. This can be done
by first checking the FAQ file. The FAQ will contain answers to many
common problems.

If your problem has occurred directly after upgrading RKH, then
please check the CHANGELOG file. It will contain information about
changes made since the previous version of RKH, and may indicate why
you are now experiencing a problem.

Users should also check the rkhunter-users mailing list archives
(available on the web site). It is very common for a problem to be
reported by more than one user. The problem will be looked at by a
member of the RKH development team, and, where appropriate, a
solution posted on the mailing list. Hence the mailing list archives
may well contain a solution to your problem.

Additionally, users should also check the RKH tracker system
(available at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=155034). It
is quite possible that your problem has already been reported to us
as a bug or support request. It is also possible that a fix for the
problem has been provided in the tracker log.

Depending upon the nature of your problem it may be worthwhile
trying an Internet search (for example using google), to see if
anyone else has experienced a similar problem.

Finally, if you have still not found an answer to your problem, then
mail it to the rkhunter-users mailing list. Please provide as much
information as possible about the problem, but do not make the
message excessively long! Information such as your operating system
and version of RKH should always be included.

If you are sure the problem is a bug, or want a feature request,
then please submit this directly into the tracker system.
