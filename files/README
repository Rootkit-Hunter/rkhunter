==========================

Copyright (c) 2003-2006, Michael Boelen
See the LICENSE file for conditions of use and distribution.

It is recommended that all users of RootKit Hunter (RKH) join the
rkhunter-users mailing list. Subscribing to the list can be done via
the RKH website at http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net

Additionally there is a low-volume rkhunter-announce mailing list,
which will contain announcements of new versions of RKH. Details of
the list can be found at the RKH web site.

A copy of the RKH FAQ is also available from the web site.


ROOTKIT HUNTER REQUIREMENTS
===========================

Please note RKH has some requirements.

Perl. Some test RKH runs require Perl. Also for some default system
tools like stat, md5sum and sha1sum alternatives are supplied which
require Perl.

A tool with which to download updates. Currently wget, curl, (e)links,
lynx and GET are supported. If your system does not allow the 
possibility to install one of these applications but does run Perl, you
can get "bget" from http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/E/EL/ELIJAH/.
If you use another generic method of updating RKH please inform us.

Single-purpose applications. RKH does not depend on these but will use 
them if found because they greatly enhance RKH's detection capabilities.
- Skdet (http://slider.decebal.org/code/skdet/): tests for SucKIT, Adore,
Adore-NG, UNFshit, UNFkmem and frontkey.
- Unhide (http://www.security-projects.com/?Unhide): find hidden processes.


ROOTKIT HUNTER INSTALLATION
===========================

Unpacking the tar file should produce a single directory call
'rkhunter'. Within this directory is the installation script called
'installer.sh'.

To install RKH simply unpack the tarball and run the installation
script:

    tar zxf rkhunter-<version>.tar.gz
    cd rkhunter
    ./installer.sh

The default installation process will install a configuration file,
called 'rkhunter.conf', into the '/usr/local/etc' directory. Please
edit the configuration file according to your own system
requirements.

The main RKH script will be installed into the '/usr/local/bin'
directory. Man pages will be installed into 'user/local/share/man',
and other documentation will be installed into the
'/usr/local/share/doc/rkhunter' directory. RKH data files, and a
directory for temporary files, will be installed into
'/usr/local/var/lib/rkhunter'. All directories will be created where
necessary.

If it is wished to install RKH into a different directory, then
there are two options which can be used:

    --installdir <dir>     specifies the main installation directory
                           (default is '/usr/local')
    --dbdir <dir>          specifies the directory for data and
                           temporary files
                           (default is '/var/lib/rkhunter')

To run RKH simply, as root, enter the following command:

    rkhunter -c

By default, the log file '/var/log/rkhunter.log' will be created. It
will contain the results of the checks made by RKH.


STANDALONE INSTALLATION
=======================

It is possible to run RKH standalone, that is, without it being
installed.

To do this unpack RKH as described above, and then install it using
the following command:

    ./installer.sh --install --layout custom .

It is then necessary to change to the 'files' directory:

    cd files

Within here will be a copy of the 'rkhunter.conf' configuration
file. You can modify this file according to your requirements if you
wish, but note the installer has already set the necessary variables.

To run RKH, enter the following command:

    ./rkhunter -c --configfile ./rkhunter.conf

If you do not want a log file produced, then append the '--nolog'
option to the above command.


ROOTKIT HUNTER SUPPORT
======================

When a problem is found with RKH it is recommended that users
initially try and resolve the problem themselves. This can be done by
first checking the FAQ file which is present in your installation if
the distributed tarball is used as source. The FAQ will contain answers 
to many common problems. The latest version of the FAQ can always be 
found at RKH's project pages at SourceForge, in the "Documentation" 
section.

If the problem has occurred directly after upgrading RKH, then please
check the CHANGELOG file. It will contain information about changes
made since the previous version of RKH, and may indicate why you are
now experiencing a problem.

Users should also check the rkhunter-users mailing list archives
(available on the web site). The problem will be looked at by the RKH
development team, and, where appropriate, a solution posted on the
mailing list. Hence the mailing list archives may well contain a
solution to the problem.

Additionally, users should check the RKH tracker system (available at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=155034). It is quite
possible that the problem has already been reported to us as a bug or
support request. It is also possible that a fix for the problem has
been provided in the tracker log.

Depending upon the nature of the problem it may be worthwhile trying
an Internet search (for example using google), to see if anyone else
has experienced a similar problem.

Finally, if you have still not found an answer to the problem, then
mail it to the rkhunter-users mailing list. Please provide as much
information as possible about the problem, but do not make the
message excessively long! Information such as your operating system
and version of RKH should always be included.

If you are sure the problem is a bug, or want it considered as a
support request, then please submit it directly into the tracker
system.
