.SH DESCRIPTION


\fBrkhunter\fP is an easy-to-use tool which checks machines running UNIX, Linux,
BSD and other clones, for the presence of rootkits and/or other unwanted tools.
\fBrkhunter\fP can be run as a cronjob, or from the command line when needed. A
Bash Shell or Korn Shell is required. If available, Perl modules will be used to
replace some default system commands.
.PP
The following system areas may be checked:
.PP
-MD5 hash comparisons
.PP
-Default files commonly used by rootkits
.PP
-Incorrect file placement (moved binaries)
.PP
-Search for suspect strings in LKM and KLD modules
.PP
-Hidden files
.PP
-Deleted files
.PP
-Interfaces in promiscuous mode
.PP
-Listening applications that could use libpcap
.PP
-Optional scan within plaintext and binary files
.PP
-Search for old versions of software packages

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B
--allow-ssh-root-user
Allow SSH `root` user, while checking the SSH configuration file.
This is a usefull option when you use public key authentication
instead of keyboard authentication.
.TP
.B
--checkall
(or -c).\fBrkhunter\fP preforms a full check of the system, printing
out the results of each test to stdout.
.TP
.B
--configfile <file>
Use another configuration file, instead of the default one
.TP
.B
--createlogfile <file>
A plain text file summarizing \fBrkhunter\fP's findings. Defaults to
/var/log/rkhunter.log, optionally another filename can be chosen.
.TP
.B
--cronjob
Use this option if you wish to run \fBrkhunter\fP from a cron-job
rather than the commandline. Removes colored layout.
.TP
.B
--dbdir
Uses another directory for the databases (instead of the default
path)
.TP
.B
--disable-md5-check
Skip checking MD5 hashes. Used on systems with custom
tools or binaries that would throw off this test.
.TP
.B
--help
Show help / usage information
.TP
.B
--nocolors
Skip colorized output
.TP
.B
--quick
Skips some tests (less accurate)
.TP
.B
--reportmode
Hide all information which not interesting for cronjobs and
non-interactive scans (like hiding header/footer)
.TP
.B
--rootdir
Changes the default root directory, for chroot environments.
.TP
.B
--tmpdir
Changes the default directory for temporary storage
.TP
.B
--skip-keypress
Make rkhunter non-interactive
.TP
.B
--check-deleted
Make rkhunter check for processes that have files opened that
are deleted from the filesystem while the process is running. 
While this could give a clue about a process intentions enabling
this check will cause false positives so enable whitelisting for 
'known good' processes that are allowed to use deleted files. 
Examples are provided in the config file.
.TP
.B
--check-listen
In addition to the ifconfig and "ip" promiscuous mode tests this makes 
rkhunter check for any applications that are listening on interfaces. 
Use on systems where the libpcap "-p" flag enables you to avoid 
interface promiscuous mode. Note any ifconfig or "ip" based promiscuous 
mode checks are obsolete on GNU/Linux systems running kernel 2.6.
Unfortunately there is no easy way to distinguish between illegitimate 
libpcap/libnet-using applications, legit ones like IDSes or plain old
DHCP clients. In short, this will definately cause false positives 
so enable whitelisting for 'known good' applications. 
Examples are provided in the config file.
.TP
.B
--versioncheck
Consults the \fBrkhunter\fP website to determine if a newer 
version is available for download. Uses wget. The latest version
can be found at http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net/
