####################################################################

 !! Important notices !!:

 - Dates in this file are formatted as DD/MM/YYYY (European format)
 - With the release of version 1.0.9, the installer has been changed
   to make Rootkit Hunter less static. It CAN now use some different
   paths than before (although it will install to the default location
   when no additional options are given). To be sure you have a clean
   install, delete the directory /usr/local/rkhunter, delete the file
   /usr/local/etc/rkhunter.conf, delete the file /usr/local/bin/rkhunter
   and reinstall the tool.
 - The rkhunter configuration file (default /usr/local/etc/rkhunter.conf)
   will not be overwritten by default (when using the rkhunter installer).
   Be sure you compare your configuration file against the one delivered
   in this package, to optimize this file for your machine.


 -- 

 * 1.3.0 (xx/xx/2006)

 New:
 - Created an ACKNOWLEDGMENTS file.
 - Added configuration file option MAIL_CMD when report-on-warning used.
   This can specify the 'mail' command to use and the subject line.
 - The log file can be appended to. This can be set in the config file or
   by using the --append-log command line option.
 - A second colour set has been added for users using RKH with black
   characters on a white screen. The command-line option --cs2 will enable it.
 - Added special config file and command-line option, -x/-X, to detect if X
   is in use. If detected then second colour set will be used.
 - Added '--md5' cli option and MD5_CMD configuration file option. This
   allows the user to specify the command to use for the MD5 'known bad'
   file hash check.
 - Added '--hashupd' option. This allows a user to create the rkhunter.dat
   file. This file contains the O/S name, file hash values and other bits of
   information. If the file hash values change, perhaps due to new versions
   of software, then the user simply runs RKH with the option again. If the
   user has not run RKH with this option, then the 'known good' hash check is
   skipped. This option obsoletes the 'hashupd.sh' script previously
   recommended to users.
 - Added '--hash' option. This allows a user to select what hash function they
   want to use for the 'known good' hash file check. By default SHA1 will be
   used. This can be overridden via the command line, or in the configuration
   file using the HASH_FUNC option. For prelinked systems, the function must
   be either MD5 or SHA1. For the 'known bad' check, the MD5 hash function
   must be used (see above), but is separate from the 'known good' function.
 - The files for the file hash checks are now 'looked for'. The code will
   search the command directories, and check the relevant files in all the
   directories. Additional commands and directories are used for both
   Solaris and MAC OS X systems. Overall more commands will be checked.
 - Added support for Ubuntu and the 'dash' shell.
 - If the O/S name, architecture or prelinking status changes from one RKH
   run to the next, then a warning message is written to the log file. The
   change may well cause the file hash checks to show false positives. (The
   user should rerun RKH with the --hashupd option.)
 - RKH will now check that certain commands are present before starting
   any checks. This avoids spurious 'command not found' type messages
   suddenly appearing.

 Changes:
 - Improved command-line and config file option checking.
 - The log file is now created by default, it can be disabled in the config
   file or by using the --nolog command line option.
 - The log file cannot be a symlink.
 - Multiple recipients may be specified with the MAIL-ON-WARNING config option.
 - Added BINDIR and ROOTDIR options to the config file.
 - Split out the README file in to README and FAQ files.
 - Solaris will now use the bash shell if available.
 - Expanded the command PATH used to include the /opt/sfw/ and usr/sfw
   directories for Solaris users.
 - Added command-line option --dac as alias for --disable-application-check.
 - Versioncheck now checks the versions numerically.
 - The MD5WHITELIST configuration file option has changed name to HASHWHITELIST.
 - The '--disable-md5-check/--dmc' option has been changed to
   '--disable-hash-check/--dhc'.
 - The '--checkall' option has been changed to '--check'. The old option is
   still recognised, but will be deprecated at some time.
 - If a logfile is to be written, but not appended to, then the old log file
   is moved to '<logfile name>.old' now. The same happens to the rkhunter.dat
   file if the --hashupd option is used.
 - The 'known bad' file hash check is now enabled by default.
 - The 'known good' hash check now also checks the files inode, uid, gid,
   permissions and modification date/time, for any changes. This is only
   for non-prelinked systems. As before, in all cases, the hash is checked.
 - Improved the O/S detection mechanism. Rather than requiring users to send
   us details, RKH actively looks at the 'release' file(s) to find the
   O/S name.
 - If the --hashupd or --update options are used, as well as the system
   check option --check, then the update checks are performed before the
   system is checked. Previously the update occurred after the system was
   checked.
 - Hidden file shearch now checks /usr/share/man directories.
 - Improved NetBSD support.
 - The supplied perl scripts, providing the stat command, md5 and sha1,
   can now be executed without perl being in the default directory (/usr/bin).

 Bugfixes:
 - Corrected SHV4/Tripwire check.
 - Command-line options requiring an argument now work correctly under Solaris.
 - The -h/--help option now works as expected.
 - The OpenBSD check for 'known bad' hashes was not matching the checksum
   correctly. The known good check, however, was.
 - The ignoKit rootkit check was not checking all the required files.
 - Some checks were not respecting the ROOTDIR option in their pathnames. This
   has now been corrected.
 - The file hash prelink test should now work, even if SELinux objects to the
   prelink command (requires the 'runcon' command).
 - Corrected file attributes check - previously the immutable flag would never
   have been found.

 * 1.0.5

 New:
 - Added 'ignoKit' (rootkit)
 - Added support for Red Hat Linux 8.0 (Psyche)
 - Added option '--disable-passwd-check', to disable passwd/group check. Suggested
   by Michael Niehren
 - Added option '--scan-knownbad-files', to scan besides the 'known good' MD5 checks,
   a lot of system binaries against a 'known bad' database.
 - Added option '--tmpdir', to specify a temporary directory instead of the static
   one (see below, at 'tmpdir' option within the configuration file).
 - Added a 'known bad' database with a lot of 'blacklisted' binaries and tools
   (like sniffers, rootkits, backdoored binaries, IRC tools etc)
 - Added hashes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 (unpatched). Thanks
   to Nico Morrison
 - Added a 'mail-on-warning' option to the configuration file. When the checker finds
   one or more warnings, it will send a warning to the system administrator (see the
   configuration file for more information)
 - Added 'tmpdir' option to the configuration. This optional value can be used instead
   of the default (/usr/local/rkhunter/tmp) directory and is one of the first steps
   to make rkhunter less static.   
 - Rootkit Hunter now exists with an exit code of 1 when a rootkit is found or
   a MD5 checksum failed. Suggested by Michael Niehren

 Changes:
 - Updated support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Thanks to Nico Morrison

 * 1.00 RC3

 New:
 - Added option --disable-md5-check to skip checking MD5 hashes (if you run 
   customized binaries/tools)
 - Added option --rootdir (or -r), to use with chrooted systems. Note: not
   completely integrated yet. Requested by Henk Wevers
 - Added functions logtext and displaytext to make script more powerfull and
   easier to use (for example with a new 'quiet' option)
 - Added support for OpenBSD 3.3 and OpenBSD 3.4 (MD5 fix added, due the
   missing of the -q (quiet) option of MD5). Thanks to Stefan

 Changes:
 - Updated 'Beastkit'
 - Updated 'BOBkit'
 - Updated hashes for Red Hat 9.0 (coreutils update). Thanks to Andrew Matthews
 - Fixed a little problem with support for multiple file hashes (see 1.00 RC2).

   to Andrew Matthews for testing.
 - Solved two little issues with netstat check. Check reported possible backdoor
   if portnumber was present in another portnumber (like string '2001' is
   available in '20010'). Also the portnumber was found when the remote connection
   had the same portnumber as a possible backdoor (like a dynamic port 2001 was
   assigned to a SSH client). Thanks to Michael Firkins
 - Changed text when a possible backdoored file is found (because --debug option
   is not a valid). Thanks to Anton Pirnat

   1 place). Thanks to Jeroen Griede
