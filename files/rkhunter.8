.SH NAME
rkhunter \- RootKit Hunter
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrkhunter\fP {--check | --update | --propupd | --versioncheck |
          --list [tests | languages | rootkits]
          --version | --help} [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrkhunter\fP is a shell script which carries out various checks on the local
system to try and detect known rootkits and malware. It also performs checks
to see if commands have been modified, if the system startup files have been
modified, and various checks on the network interfaces, including checks for
listening applications.

\fBrkhunter\fP has been written to be as generic as possible, and so should run
on most Linux and UNIX systems. It is provided with some support scripts should
certain commands be missing from the system, and some of these are perl scripts.
\fBrkhunter\fP does require certain commands to be present for it to be able
to execute. Additionally, some tests require specific commands, but if these
are not present then the test will be skipped. \fBrkhunter\fP needs to be run
under a Bourne\-type shell, typically \fBbash\fP or \fBksh\fP. \fBrkhunter\fP
can be run as a cron job or from the command\-line.

.PP
.SH COMMAND OPTIONS
If no command option is given, then \fB\-\-help\fP is assumed.
\fBrkhunter\fP will return a non-zero exit code if any error or warning occurs.

.PP
.IP "\fB\-c, \-\-check\fP"
This command option tells \fBrkhunter\fP to perform various checks on the local
system. The result of each test will be displayed on stdout. If anything
suspicious is found, then a warning will be displayed. A log file of the tests
and the results will be automatically produced.

It is suggested that this command option is run regularly in order to ensure
that the system has not been compromised.

.IP

.IP \fB\-\-update\fP
This command option causes \fBrkhunter\fP to check if there is a later version
of any of its text data files. A command\-line web browser, for example
\fBwget\fP or \fBlynx\fP, must be present on the system when using this option.

It is suggested that this command option is run regularly in order to ensure
that the data files are kept up to date.

An exit code of zero for this command option means that no updates were
available. An exit code of one means that a download error occurred, and a code
of two means that no error occurred but updates were available and have been
installed.

.IP

.IP \fB\-\-propupd\fP
One of the checks \fBrkhunter\fP performs is to compare various current file
properties of various commands, against those it has previously stored. This
command option causes \fBrkhunter\fP to update its data file of stored values
with the current values.

\fIWARNING:\fP It is the users responsibility to ensure that the files on the
system are genuine and from a reliable source. \fBrkhunter\fP can only report
if a file has changed, but not on what has caused the change. Hence, if a file
has changed, and the \fB\-\-propupd\fP command option is used, then
\fBrkhunter\fP will assume that the file is genuine.

.IP

.IP \fB\-\-versioncheck\fP
This command option causes \fBrkhunter\fP to check if there is a later version
of the program. A command\-line web browser must be present on the system when
using this option.

An exit code of zero for this command option means that no new version was
available. An exit code of one means that an error occurred downloading the
latest version number, and a code of two means that no error occurred but a
new version is available.

.IP

.IP "\fB\-\-list [tests | languages | rootkits]\fP"
This command option will list some of the supported capabilities of the
program, and then exit. The \fItests\fP option lists the currently available
test names (see the README file for more details about test names). The
\fIlanguages\fP option lists the currently available languages, and the
\fIrootkits\fP option lists the rootkits that \fBrkhunter\fP will search for.
If no specific option is given, then all the lists are displayed.

.IP

.IP "\fB\-V, \-\-version\fP"
This command option causes \fBrkhunter\fP to display its version number, and
then exit.

.IP

.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
.br
This command option displays the help screen menu, and then exits.

.IP

.SH OPTIONS
\fBrkhunter\fP uses a configuration file, named \fIrkhunter.conf\fP, for many of
its configuration options. However, some options can also be specified on the
command\-line, and these will override the configuration file options. The
configuration file options are well documented within the file itself. The
following are the command\-line options. The defaults mentioned here are the
program defaults, unless explicitly stated as the configuration file default.

.PP

.IP \fB\-\-appendlog\fP
By default a new log file will be created when \fBrkhunter\fP runs. This option
tells \fBrkhunter\fP to append to the existing log file. If the log file does
not exist, then it will be created.

.IP "\fB\-\-bindir <directory>...\fP"
This option tells \fBrkhunter\fP which directories to look in to find the
various commands it requires. The default is the current PATH environment
variable, and the typical command directories of /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin and so
on.

.IP "\fB\-\-cs2, \-\-color\-set2\fP"
By default \fBrkhunter\fP will display its test results in color. The colors
used are green for successful tests, red for failed tests (warnings), and
yellow for skipped tests. These colors are visible when a black background is
used, but are difficult to see on a white background. This option tells
\fBrkhunter\fP to use a different color set which is more suited to a white
background.

.IP "\fB\-\-configfile <file>\fP"
The installation process will automatically tell \fBrkhunter\fP where its
configuration file is located. However, if necessary, this option can be used
to specify a different pathname.

.IP \fB\-\-cronjob\fP
This is similar to the \fB\-\-check\fP command option, but it disables several
of the interactive options. When this option is used \fB\-\-check\fP,
\fB\-\-nocolors\fP and \fB\-\-skip-keypress\fP are assumed. By default no output
is sent to stdout, so the \fB\-\-report-warnings-only\fP option may be useful
with this option.

.IP "\fB\-\-dbdir <directory>\fP"
The installation process will automatically configure where the data files are
stored for \fBrkhunter\fP. However, if necessary, this option can be used
to specify a different directory.

.IP \fB\-\-debug\fP
This is a special option mainly for the developers. It produces no output on
stdout.

.IP "\fB\-\-disable <test>[,<test>...]\fP"
This option tells \fBrkhunter\fP not to run the specified tests. If this
option is used, and \fB\-\-propupd\fP is not specified, then the
\fB\-\-check\fP command option is assumed. Read the README file for more
information about test names. By default no tests are disabled.

.IP \fB\-\-display\-logfile\fP
This option will cause the logfile to be displayed on the screen once
\fBrkhunter\fP has finished.

.IP "\fB\-\-enable <test>[,<test>...]\fP"
This option tells \fBrkhunter\fP to only run the specified tests. If this
option is used, and \fB\-\-propupd\fP is not specified, then the
\fB\-\-check\fP command option is assumed. If only one test name, other than
\fIall\fP, is given, then the \fB\-\-skip\-keypress\fP option is also assumed.
Read the README file for more information about test names. By default all
tests are enabled.

.IP "\fB\-\-hash {MD5 | SHA1 | NONE | <command>}\fP"
Both the file properties check and the \fB\-\-propupd\fP command option will
use a hash function to determine a files current hash value. This option tells
\fBrkhunter\fP which hash function to use. The \fIMD5\fP and \fISHA1\fP
options, in uppercase, will look for the relevant command, and if not found
a perl support script will be used to provide the function. Alternatively, a
specific \fIcommand\fP may be specified. A value of \fINONE\fP can be used
to indicate that the hash values should not be obtained or used as part of the
file properties check. The default is \fISHA1\fP, or \fIMD5\fP if no SHA1
command can be found.

.IP "\fB\-\-lang, \-\-language <language>\fP"
This option specifies which language to use for the displayed tests and results.
The currently supported languages can be seen by the \fB\-\-list\fP command
option. The default is \fIen\fP (English). If a message to be displayed cannot
be found in the language file, then the English version will be used. As such,
the English language file must always be present. The \fB\-\-update\fP command
option will update the language files when new versions are available.

.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-logfile [file]\fP"
By default \fBrkhunter\fP will write out a log file. The default location of
the file is \fI/var/log/rkhunter.log\fP. However, this location can be changed
by using this option. If \fI/dev/null\fP is specified as the log file, then no
log file will be written. If no specific \fIfile\fP is given, then the default
will be used. By default \fBrkhunter\fP will create a new log file each time
it is run. Any previously existing logfile is moved out of the way, and has
\fI.old\fP appended to it.

.IP \fB\-\-noappend\-log\fP
This option reverts \fBrkhunter\fP to its default behaviour of creating a new
log file rather than appending to it.

.IP \fB\-\-nocolors\fP
This option causes the result of each test to not be displayed in a specific
color. The default color, usually the reverse of the background color, will be
used (typically this is just black and white).

.IP \fB\-\-nolog\fP
This option tells \fBrkhunter\fP not to write anything to a log file.

.IP "\fB\-\-nomow, \-\-no\-mail\-on\-warning\fP"
The configuration file has an option which will cause a simple email message to
be sent to a user should \fBrkhunter\fP detect any warnings. This command\-line
option overrides the configuration file option, and prevents the email message
from being sent. This can be useful when running \fBrkhunter\fP via cron, where
cron may email the user itself or \fBrkhunter\fP may have its output piped
through to the \fImail\fP command. The configuration file default is not to
email a message to the user.

.IP "\fB\-\-ns, \-\-nosummary\fP"
When the \fB\-\-check\fP command option is used, by default a short summary of
results is displayed at the end. This option prevents the summary from being
displayed.

.IP "\fB\-\-novl, \-\-no\-verbose\-logging\fP"
During some tests \fBrkhunter\fP will log a lot of information. Use of this
option reduces the amount of logging, and so can improve the performance of
\fBrkhunter\fP. However, the log file will contain less information should any
warnings occur. By default verbose logging is enabled.

.IP "\fB\-\-pkgmgr {RPM | DPKG | BSD | NONE}\fP"
This option is used during the file properties check or when the
\fB\-\-propupd\fP command option is given. It tells \fBrkhunter\fP that the
current file property values should be obtained from the relevant package manager.
See the README file for more details of this option. The default is \fINONE\fP,
which means not to use a package manager.

.IP "\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fP"
This option tells \fBrkhunter\fP not to display any output. It can be useful
when only the exit code is going to be checked. Other options may be used with
this one, to force only specific items to be displayed.

.IP "\fB\-\-rwo, \-\-report\-warnings\-only\fP"
This option causes only warning messages to be displayed. This can be
useful when \fBrkhunter\fP is run via cron. Other options may be used to
force other items of information to be displayed.

.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-rootdir <directory>\fP"
If a suspect system is locally or remotely mounted, it is possible to tell
\fBrkhunter\fP to inspect it by using this option. However, it must be used
with care, as several of the other options specifying configuration
directories may need to be set as well. There is no default.

.IP "\fB\-\-sk, \-\-skip\-keypress\fP"
When the \fB\-\-check\fP command option is used, after certain sections of
tests, the user will be prompted to press the \fIreturn\fP key in order to
continue. This option disables that feature, and \fBrkhunter\fP will run until
all the tests have completed.

.IP \fB\-\-summary\fP
This option will cause the summary of test results to be displayed. This is
the default.

.IP "\fB\-\-syslog [facility.priority]\fP"
When the \fB\-\-check\fP command option is used, this option will cause the
start and finish times to be logged to syslog. The default is not to log
anything to syslog, but if the option is used, then the default level
is \fIauthpriv.notice\fP.

.IP "\fB\-\-tmpdir <directory>\fP"
The installation process will automatically configure where temporary files are
to be created. However, if necessary, this option can be used to specify a
different directory. The directory must not be a symbolic link, and must be
secure (root access only).

.IP "\fB\-\-vl, \-\-verbose\-logging\fP"
This option tells \fBrkhunter\fP that when it runs some tests, it should log
as much information as possible. This can be useful when trying to diagnose
why a warning has occurred, but it obviously also takes more time. The default
is to use verbose logging.

.IP "\fB\-x, \-\-autox\fP"
When this option is used, \fBrkhunter\fP will try and detect if the X Window
system is in use. If it is in use, then the second color set will
automatically be used (see the \fB\-\-color\-set2\fP option). This allows
\fBrkhunter\fP to be run on, for example, a server console (where X is not
present, so the default color set should be used), and on a users terminal
(where X is in use, so the second color set should be used). In both cases
\fBrkhunter\fP will use the correct color set. The configuration file default
is to try and detect X.

.IP "\fB\-X, \-\-no\-autox\fP"
This option prevents \fBrkhunter\fP from automatically detecting if the X
Window system is being used. See the \fB\-\-autox\fP option.
