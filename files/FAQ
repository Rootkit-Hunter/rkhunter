===========================================================

1. GENERAL QUESTIONS
====================

1.1) What is Rootkit Hunter?

A.   Rootkit Hunter (RKH) is an easy-to-use tool which checks
     computers running UNIX (clones) for the presence of rootkits
     and other unwanted tools.


1.2) What are rootkits?

A.   Most times they are self-hiding toolkits used by blackhats,
     crackers and scriptkiddies, to avoid the eye of the sysadmin.


1.3) Can I help with the development of this project?

A.   Yes, everyone can help in some way. For example:

     Help your fellow Rootkit Hunter users on the rkhunter-users
     mailing list;

     Send a copy of an undetected rootkit to us so that it can
     be added and help others;

     Translate RKH messages to your native language. For the
     template see the standard language file i18n/en.

     Are you a package maintainer? If so, then please submit
     your changes to us so that everyone can benefit from them;

     Are you an end-user? FOSS, and hence RKH, ultimately depends
     upon you. Contributing is your responsibility, not someone
     elses. Whatever you contribute is very much welcomed. For
     example, contribute or discuss enhancing Rootkit Hunter with
     us; submit a patch or discuss enhancements; file a bug
     report; or test the application by using it on your servers.


1.4) I like your software! How can I thank you?

A.   Simple - by contributing. See question 1.3 above.


===========================================================

2. INSTALLATION QUESTIONS
=========================

2.1) How do I install Rootkit Hunter?

A.   Instructions on installing RKH can be found in the README file.


2.2) How do I create a Rootkit Hunter RPM file?

A.   The RKH source contains an rkhunter.spec file which will
     allow an RPM to be built. To build the RPM run the following
     command:

            rpmbuild -ta rkhunter-<version>.tar.gz

     NOTE: The RKH development team do not support any third-party
     RPM files. However, the rkhunter.spec file will be maintained. 


===========================================================

3. USAGE QUESTIONS
==================

3.1) Rootkit Hunter tells me there is something wrong with my
     system. What do I do?

A.   Prior to any incident it is recommended that you have read
     "Intruder Detection Checklist". This is available from
     http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/intruder_detection_checklist.html
     This document will tell you what to check, and makes it easier
     for you to find out and answer any questions.

     If you are unsure as to whether your system is compromised,
     you can get a second opinion from sources such as the
     rkhunter-users mailing list, the Linux-oriented forum
     LinuxQuestions.org, or even IRC. Please note you need to 
     subscribe before posting to the rkhunter-users mailing list.

     If a file property check fails, then it is possible you have
     what is called a 'false positive'. Sometimes this will happen
     due to package updates, customised configurations or changed
     binaries. If so, then please check further:

       1. If you run a file integrity checker, for example Aide,
          Samhain, or tripwire, consult the results from running those
          tools. Note they must be installed directly after the O/S
          installation in order to be useful, and you must keep a copy
          of the binary, configuration files and databases off-site.
          Also note that running those tools, and Rootkit Hunter, is no
          substitute for updating software when updates are released,
          and proper host and network hardening.

       2. If you don't run a file integrity checker you can possibly
          use your distributions package management system if it is
          configured to deal with verification.

       3. Run 'strings <file>' and check the results for untrusted file
          paths (for example, /dev/.hiddendir).

       4. Check recently updated binaries and their original source.

       5. Run 'file <file>' and compare the results with other files,
          especially trusted binaries. If some binaries are statically
          linked and others are all dynamic, then they could have been
          trojaned.

     If you have a warning from another part of the checks, then
     please subscribe first and then email the rkhunter-users mailing list
     and tell us about your system configuration:
        the purpose of the server (for example, web server, intranet
        fileserver, shell server);
        the (aproximate) date of the incident and when you found out;
        the running distribution name, release and kernel version;
        whether any passwd/shadow file data has changed;
        any anomalies you find from reading the system, daemon, IDS
        and firewall logs;
        if all the installed software was recently updated;
        what services are or were running at the time;
        if you found setuid root files in directories for temporary
        files;
        any anomalies you find from reading user shell histories.

     If your system is infected with a rootkit, cleaning it up is
     not an option. Restoring is also not an option unless you are
     skilled, and have autonomous and an independent means of
     verifying that the backup is clean, and does not contain
     misconfigured or stale software. Never trust a compromised
     machine. Period.

     Read "Steps for Recovering from a UNIX or NT System Compromise".
     This is available from
     http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html

     A clean install of the system is recommended after backing up
     the full system. To do this follow these steps:

       1. Stay calm. Be methodical.

       2. From another machine inform users, and the network,
          facility or host owner, that the machine is compromised.

       3. Get the host offline or make sure the firewall is raised
          to only allow network traffic to and from your management
          IP address or range.

       4. Backup your data. If you do not intend to investigate the
          problem, then do not backup any binaries or binary data
          which you cannot verify.

       5. Verify the integrity of your backup by visual inspection
          (authentication data, configurations, log files), or by
          using a file integrity checker or your distributions
          package management tools.

       6. Install your host with a fresh install. Whilst you are
          updating and configuring the software and services,
          restrict network access to the system using authentication
          features like accounts, PAM, firewall, TCP wrappers, and
          daemon configurations. Make sure you properly harden the
          machine.

       7. Investigate the old log files, and the tools used if
          possible. Also investigate the services which were
          vulnerable at the time of attack.


3.2) Rootkit Hunter tells me that I have an out-of-date or unsecure
     application installed. But I have fully patched my server!
     How is this possible?

A.   Some distributions, for example Red Hat and OpenBSD, do patch
     old versions of software. However, Rootkit Hunter thinks it is
     an old version, and so sees it as being unsecure.

     If you wish you can skip the application version check by adding
     the 'apps' test name to the DISABLE_TESTS option in your
     rkhunter.conf file.


3.3) How can I automatically run Rootkit Hunter every day?

A.   You can create a cronjob script like this:

          #!/bin/sh

          ( /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --versioncheck
            /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --update
            /usr/local/bin/rkhunter --cronjob --rwo --nomow
          ) | /bin/mail -s 'rkhunter Daily Run' root

     For Linux systems, if the script is saved in the
     /etc/cron.daily directory, then the system will automatically
     run it once per day.

     Alternatively, the rkhunter command can be added directly to
     your root crontab. For example:

        30 5 * * * </path>/rkhunter --cronjob --rwo --nomow <more options>

     Rootkit Hunter will now run every day at 5:30 (AM).


3.4) What is the meaning of the test names?

A.   See the README file for information about the test names.


3.5) Can rkhunter handle filenames with spaces in them?

A.   Generally no. Within the tests the space character is typically
     used to delimit command output fields. Some tests will work, but
     others will not.


3.6) What does the following warning mean:

       Determining OS... Warning: this operating system is not
       fully supported!

A.   This is a message from older versions of rkhunter. Upgrade to
     a newer version.


3.7) I have just installed Rootkit Hunter, and I am already
     getting warning messages. Why is that?

A.   The first run of rkhunter after an installation will give some
     warning messages. One of the checks is that the file of file
     properties (called 'rkhunter.dat') for the file properties
     checks exists. This file won't exist until rkhunter is run with
     the '--propupd' option. Two other warning messages will relate
     to checks of changes to the passwd and group files. To do this,
     rkhunter must use a copy of the files. However, since no copies
     yet exist, warnings are generated. These warnings will disappear
     once rkhunter is run again. There is also a check to see if any
     commands have been replaced by shell scripts. One of the commands
     is 'rkhunter' itself. To avoid these warning messages you must
     whitelist the commands in your rkhunter.conf file. Look in the
     configuration file and you will find examples of this.

     Once these changes have been made, then re-run rkhunter and no
     warnings should appear. Obviously warning messages from other
     checks indicate that something is wrong, and should be
     investigated. The logfile will contain further information about
     each warning message.

     NOTE: When using the '--propupd' option it is the users
           responsibility to ensure that the files on their system are
           genuine. Rootkit Hunter can only inform the user of a change
           to the files, not whether they are the original files or not.
           Although Rootkit Hunter can use a package manager for some
           systems, it must be remembered that the package manager itself
           uses files stored on the system. Those files may have been
           tampered with.


3.8) When I used the '--propupd' option, Rootkit Hunter told me
     I had some missing hashes. What does this mean?

A.   Your system probably uses prelinking (the log file will say if
     it does or not). Sometimes a file may be updated but not be
     prelinked. When this happens RKH cannot determine the files hash
     value. If you run the command 'prelink --verify --sha <file>'
     on the file, it will probably give an error about the files
     dependencies having changed. This is what RKH sees, and flags
     it as a missing hash. If you are sure that the file is genuine,
     then you may try using 'prelink <file>' to correct it. The
     'prelink' command above should then work. Re-run RKH with the
     '--propupd' option to ensure that all the hash values are recorded.


===========================================================

4. ERROR AND WARNING MESSAGES
=============================

4.1) What does the following warning mean:

       The file of stored file properties (rkhunter.dat) is empty,
       and so must be created. To do this type in
       'rkhunter --propupd'.

A.   For rkhunter to perform file property checks, it must first
     have a database file ('rkhunter.dat') containing the property
     values for each file. It can then compare each files current
     values against those stored in the database. Any difference
     indicates that the file has changed. To create and/or update
     the database file use the '--propupd' option.

     NOTE: An additional warning will be displayed stating that it
           is the users responsibility to ensure that the files are
           valid before using the '--propupd' option. That is, the
           user must be sure that the files have not been compromised.


4.2) Rootkit Hunter skips some checks, and the logfile indicates
     that certain commands are missing. What can I do?

A.   You have a choice:

       1) Install the relevant command. You may be able to do this
          simply by running a package updater for your system (for
          example, 'yum' or 'apt-get').

       2) You may be able to disable the check by adding its test
          name to your rkhunter.conf file. (See the README file
          for more information about the test names.)

       3) If you are sure that the relevant command is present on
          your system, then rkhunter is having a problem locating
          it. Check the logfile for the 'command directories' it
          is using. If the directory containing the command isn't
          listed, then you can set the command directories to use
          by using the '--bindir' command-line option, or the BINDIR
          option in the rkhunter.conf file.


4.3) I get warnings from PHP like:

        PHP Warning: Function registration failed - duplicate name
        - pg_update in Unknown on line 0. What does this mean?

A.   This is usually because you have updated the Apache version
     of PHP, but forgot to update/recompile the CLI (console
     version) of PHP. So recompile/update it and try again.


4.4) After performing some updates, all, or some, binaries in the
     file properties checks are marked with a 'Warning'.
     What can I do?

A.   The first thing would be to verify that the update is the cause
     of the warnings. Checking the system log files should indicate
     what has been updated.

     It is most likely that the stored rkhunter file property values
     need to be recalculated. To do this use the RKH '--propupd'
     option. However, the output of the RKH file hash value check
     should only be seen as an indication that the file has changed.
     Updating the stored hash values should be done only after proper
     verification of the files using a file integrity checker or your
     distributions package management tools.

     Alteratively, you can use the '--pkgmgr' command-line option, or
     the PKGMGR option in the configuration file, to tell RKH to obtain
     its file properties information from the package manager database.
     If the USE_PKGMGR_VERIFY configuration file option is also used,
     then RKH will use the result of the package manager verification
     rather than the values stored in the rkhunter.dat file. See the
     README file for more information about the package manager options.

     NOTES
     =====
     1) If the logfile indicates that a files' hash value has changed
        from some value to 'No hash value found', and your system
        uses prelinking, then the file probably needs to be
        specifically prelinked. This can usually be done by running
        the 'prelink' command on the relevant file. Running RKH with
        the '--propupd' option afterwards will indicate if there
        are still any hash values missing. Check the logfile and
        repeat the above process of prelinking the files.

        RKH will try and determine if your system is using prelinking
        or not. The logfile will contain the result of the check.

     2) If your system uses Libsafe and prelinking, then errors can
        occur. Disable preloading Libsafe in /etc/ld.so.preload.
        Prelink again, and then run 'rkhunter --propupd'.

5. UPDATING QUESTIONS
=====================

5.1) Rootkit Hunter tells me that I have multiple versions
     installed. How it this possible?

A.   Usually you install a tool and upgrade it later. Sometimes
     if you use a 'non-official' updater or package manager
     (for example, from an external party, or a build from source
     using an installer like RPM/DEB/TGZ), the binaries may be
     installed into a different location from the original. So there
     are then two binaries with the same name, but in different
     locations. You will have to check which are the old binaries,
     and remove them.


5.2) Can I be notified when a new release will be available?

A.   Yes, you can join the rkhunter-announce mailing list. This is
     a low volume list. Details can be found on the RKH web site.

     Additionally, the '--versioncheck' option of rkhunter itself
     will indicate if a new version is available.
