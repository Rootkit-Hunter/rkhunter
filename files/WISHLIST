# WISHLIST : Personal and public 'wishes' for Rootkit Hunter
#
# Notes:
# - All things below CAN be integrated in future, but there are no planned
#   dates available.
#
# - This file will be maintained as much as possible, but can be outdated.
#   See changelog for latest additions.
#
# - I have also a book wishlist. Do you like rkhunter or want to have a nice
#   banner on my website? Have a look at www.rootkit.nl and see how you
#   can support development of rkhuner.
#
#

#
# Request:
# - Do you have a copy of an undetected rootkit? Please send it to me, so
#   it can be added and help others.

   *** Maybe someone likes to help me with this? I like an objective comparison, not
       a commercial bullsh*t comparison which tells all other competitors are bad ;-)

 NetBSD:
 - Remove whereis parameter '-b' (doesn't exist)
 - Use /usr/pkg/bin/perl instead of /usr/bin/perl
