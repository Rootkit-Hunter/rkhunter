# WISHLIST : Personal and public 'wishes' for Rootkit Hunter
#
# Notes:
# - All things below CAN be integrated in future, but there are no planned
#   dates available. *Your* support can change help that!
#
#################################################################################
#
# Request:
# - Do you have a copy of an undetected rootkit? Please send it to us, so
#   it can be added and help others.
# - Are you a package maintainer? Please submit your changes through
#   rkhunter.sourceforge.net so *everyone* can benefit from it.
# - Are you an enduser? If you want to submit a patch or discuss enhancements,
#   file a bug report, have comments, gripes or questions please
#   visit rkhunter.sourceforge.net on how you can best reach the project team and
#   fellow Rootkit Hunter users.

 Project:
 - more dedicated medior developers
 - more dedicated testers

 Important:
 - Add MD5 check for unknown OSes
 - Add/improve Tuxkit
 - Missing hashes for any releases of supported O.S.es
 - Promiscuous mode detection. In kernel-2.6 the ifconfig + ip (iproute2) 
   method is no longer working.

 Startup:
 - Comparing LKM/KLD startups from rc-scripts (differences)
 - Checking for kldload (*BSD) and loading of LKMs in rc-scripts
 - Black/whitelisting of LKM/KLD
 
 Processes:
 - Check for multiple instances of tools (like file, ls, ps, find)

 Support:
 - Set lo interface into promisc mode to test ifconfig
 - Improve support for Sebek LKM
 - Option to use Perl modules on a different place than the usual
   (requested by Henk Wevers)
 - Debian package (.deb)
 
 Misc:
 - Scanning of multiple machines by using a central server
 - Add support for SSH version of SSH.com
 
 Website:
 - Adding comparision between Rootkit Hunter and other projects (pros/cons).
   *** Maybe someone would like to help us with this? I would like an objective comparison.

 NetBSD:
 - Remove whereis parameter '-b' (doesn't exist)
 - Use /usr/pkg/bin/perl instead of /usr/bin/perl
